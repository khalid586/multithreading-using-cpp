## Multithreading
- [Race condition](#race-condition)
- [Mutex lock](#mutex-lock)


### Race Condition
- Race condition is such a condition where multiple threads/ processes are trying to modify a shared resource concurrently and the outcome depends on the **unpredictable** order of execution

### Mutex Lock
- Mutex(Mutual exclusion) lock is a synchronization mechanism which prevents multiple threads from accessing shared resources simultaneously to prevent race condition.
